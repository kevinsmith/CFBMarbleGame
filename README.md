## The Algorithm
_[From David Burge](https://x.com/iowahawkblog/status/1706341845326876998), with a tiny correction since there's only 4 power conferences now._

Brief primer on the Marble Game algorithm:

1. Every FBS school starts off with 100 marbles, plus 10 bonus marbles for every P4 opponent on their schedule

2. Beat your opponent at your home place or neutral site, take 20% of their marbles; beat your opponent at their home place, take 25% of their marbles

3. Fractional marbles are rounded to nearest whole number. For example, if you beat an opponent with 210 marbles at their place, you would get 25% of their 210, 52.5, which would be rounded up to 53.

4. If you beat an FCS opponent, you get nothing, If you lose to an FCS opponent, they get 25% of your marbles. Because FU coward.

That's it, that's the whole algorithm.
